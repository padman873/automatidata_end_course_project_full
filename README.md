# automatidata_end_course_project_full

This repository contains the full end-of-course project for the AutomatiData program. It showcases the progression of skills and knowledge gained across six modules, culminating in various deliverables for each course.

**The overarching goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in the data analytics lifecycle, from data collection and cleaning to exploratory data analysis, visualization, and the translation of data into actionable insights.**

Within each course folder, you will find the specific deliverables mentioned above. The "Lab Materials" folder will contain code notebooks (`.ipynb` files), datasets, and any supporting files used for the hands-on exercises. The "PACE Strategy Document" outlines the planning and approach, and the "Executive Summary" provides a concise overview of the key findings and outcomes for that course.

## Getting Started

To explore the deliverables for each course, navigate to the respective folder. The lab materials can be opened and run using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. The PACE strategy documents and executive summaries are typically in PDF or Markdown format.

### Prerequisites

To interact with the lab materials, you will need:

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook (or JupyterLab)
* Key Python libraries for data science, such as:
    * NumPy
    * Pandas
    * Matplotlib
    * Seaborn
    * Scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
